Busy Seas is a small game I developed for the Godot Wild Jam 41 Game Jam hosted on itch.io. It's a recurring event that happens every second weekend of the month and lasts 9 days, and happened to line up perfectly to my Covid-19 isolation period.

January 2022's theme was "Ocean", and had optional challenges to include a fishing mini-game and provide all sound effects with voices. Developing the game was a lot of fun, and thanks to my friend "Mufty" for providing voice effects.

The game was developed entirely in Godot 3.4 (using GDScript), with art done in Aseprite!

I hope you enjoy playing the game!
